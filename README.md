Program execution will start from if \_\_name\_\_=="\_\_main\_\_" condition, which is at the end of both the files. <br>
1. Run vit_radiomic.py to execute vit model with radiomic features code. To run this script simply write python vit_radiomic.py on the terminal. <br>
2. Else run vit.py to execute only vit model. To run this script simply write python vit.py on the terminal. <br>
3. The libraries required for this project are given in requirements.txt. <br>
4. Link to the model: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1M5hxkW8tGakwGU0lyXjQdfNmqp_g-7s1?usp=sharing (currently I only have that ViT model - which is trained without considering Radiomic Features)
